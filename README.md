# Rick and Morty GraphQL Queries

This project demonstrates how to interact with the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql) using three different approaches:

1. **Querying specific characters by ID**
2. **Querying paginated lists of characters using pages**
3. **Query to fetch the details of a specific episode using its ID**
